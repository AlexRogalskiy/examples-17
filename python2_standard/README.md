### NOTES

Python/Flask apps require, at least, one HTTP call, so the app gets a chance to load extra dependencies it needs.

The `_docker-slim.env` file declares the environment variables required by the `docker-slim` helper scripts (in `_docker-slim`). See [`_docker-slim/README.md`](_docker-slim/README.md) for more details.
