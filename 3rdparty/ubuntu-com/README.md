## NOTES

This example shows how to minify the [`official Ubuntu website`](https://github.com/canonical-web-and-design/ubuntu.com) docker image (a Flask-based web app that uses dynamic templates). It's a good example of how to use custom HTTP probes and how to include additional static assets your web application might need. The image repo is not copied because it's pretty big and it's possible that, at some point, this minification example will no longer work if the image repo is significantly refactored.
